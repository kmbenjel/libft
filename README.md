Welcome! My name is Khalid.

This includes my solution to the libft project at 1337 School (42-Network), a rich library of functions in C to use in the upcoming projects, where you're not allowed to use the standard C libraries unless stated in the subject, you should use your own code instead.

This project will have many changes and many new functions added to the library as needed for my work along the journey.
