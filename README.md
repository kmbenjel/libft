Welcome!

That was my solution to the libft project at 1337 school (42-Network).

I discourage from using it while working on the same level at school, id'd rather recommend using it after the validation of your own libft project in the Intra, either just to learn more through analysing someone else's code, or even to pick some of my implementations for your personal libft copy that you will use in your latter projects.

All of the code is original. While working, I was not getting inspired by reading others' code, except for `FT_LSTCLEAR`, where I picked a Github Copilot suggestion. I'm sure you'd appreciate a considerable part of the work.
